# SimpleGeo on OS X

**This is SimpleGeo's sample Mac application.**

This app demonstrates how to integrate [`SimpleGeo.framework`](https://github.com/simplegeo/simplegeo.framework) into an OS X project. The app uses the framework to make API requests to SimpleGeo [Context,](https://simplegeo.com/products/context/) [Places,](https://simplegeo.com/products/places/) and [Storage.](https://simplegeo.com/products/storage/)

[`SimpleGeo-Mac`] allows you to query SimpleGeo Context, Places, and Storage via a GUI for Mac OS X.

## Getting Started

1. Download [`SimpleGeo.framework`](https://github.com/simplegeo/simplegeo.framework) and drag it into the Resources/ subdirectory.

2. Start coding!
